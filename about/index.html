<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>This site is essentially the result of those weird questions I find myself wondering about and the train of thought I followed. Since my curiosity tends to pull me in all directions, I thought I could write about them here and if I happen to not pursue that thought, somebody else will. Most of the posts are completed using a combination of open source tools and scripts I write myself. The topic may range from anything related to Machine Learning, Robotics to Data Analysis.</p>
<p>As you can see, I digress&hellip; A lot&hellip;</p>
<p>Apart from Ai, I like to play Tennis, watch Formula 1, biking, street art, photography. Apparently, World Travel is not on that list. My long term goal with this project is to become better at writing, teaching, and presenting technical topics.</p>
<p>I am a Graduate Student at <em>University of Cincinnati</em> studying Mechanical Engineering.</p>
